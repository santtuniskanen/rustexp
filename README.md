A repository containing code written in Rust

For fun and experimentation

# Setting up a project
When starting a new project, we need to type the following piece of code into our terminal <br>
`$ cargo new {project_name}` ->
`cd {project_name}`

The project will contain our `src` directory, which contains our main `main.rs` file and other source files. <br>
The new directory made with the 'cargo new' command will also contain `cargo.toml` file, where we can add dependencies. We can find libraries, called 'crates' at [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
