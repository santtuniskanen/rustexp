# Rust Experimentation
A repository containing code written in Rust.
I am documenting my learning process here.<br>
Almost all of the information here comes from the book, [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) 

Despite most of the information coming from that book, I am trying to explain these concepts to myself instead of just copying them. For experimentation and fun!

# Setting up a project
When starting a new project, we need to type the following piece of code into our terminal <br>
`$ cargo new {project_name}` ->
`cd {project_name}`

The project will contain our `src` directory, which contains our main `main.rs` file and other source files. <br>
The new directory made with the 'cargo new' command will also contain `cargo.toml` file, where we can add dependencies. We can find libraries, called 'crates' at [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
